# Army Fight via processes

## About project 
This is too compilcated project.
Father process creates mutex,filemapping & two processes(Army1.exe, Arm2.exe).
Mutex is required that processes can write in shared memory without disturb each other.
FileMapping is required that processes can communicate to each other via shared memory.

P.S. 
Don't worry if the Army1 wins too frequent. It can be occur because the Army1 is always the first to attack.
Try a few times and Army2 will win.
There you can blame to the random generazer.
